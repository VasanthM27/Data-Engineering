# End-to-End Data Engineering Project with Microsoft Azure Services

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline leveraging **Azure** services, including **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**, **Azure Synapse Analytics**, **Azure Data Factory**, and **Databricks**. The project focuses on building a **Purchasing Intelligence Dashboard** that provides actionable insights to top-level stakeholders by uncovering trends in purchasing data across multiple regions, suppliers, and products. 

It follows the **Bronze-Silver-Gold layer architecture** for structured data processing and involves incremental data loads, advanced automations, and interactive reporting through **Power BI**.

## Project Components

### **Azure Services Used**
- **ADLS Gen2**: Raw data storage for unprocessed purchasing data.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehouse for querying and storing transformed data.
- **Azure Data Factory**: ETL/ELT orchestration tool for automating data pipelines.
- **Databricks**: Spark-based platform for data transformations using **PySpark**.
- **Delta Lake**: Ensures ACID transactions and scalable data lake management.
- **Power BI**: Final presentation layer for building interactive dashboards.

## Project Architecture and Pipeline

### **1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)**
- Ingested raw purchasing data from multiple sources, including **CSV**, **JSON**, and **API** outputs, into **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2**.
- The raw data contains information about **orders, suppliers, customers, products, and sales transactions**.
- Files are stored in the **Bronze layer** (raw format) with minimal transformations.

### **2. Data Transformation (Silver Layer)**
- Used **Databricks Notebooks** with **PySpark** to perform data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment.
- Standardized columns, remove duplicates, handle null values, and apply business rules.
- Stored the cleaned and transformed data in the **Silver layer** for further analysis.

### **3. Data Aggregation and Modeling (Gold Layer)**
- Performed aggregations, data modeling, and complex calculations (e.g., Total Spend, Top Performing Products, Supplier Performance, etc.) using **Spark SQL**.
- Created **Delta Lake** tables for faster querying and data consistency.
- Stored the processed data in the **Gold layer**, ready for final consumption.

### **4. Data Pipeline Automation**
- Designed automated data pipelines using **Azure Data Factory** for continuous data integration, including:
    - **Incremental load** for new/updated records.
    - **Full load** for complete data refresh when necessary.
- Scheduled pipeline execution for daily, weekly, or monthly intervals to ensure up-to-date reporting.

### **5. Data Visualization and Reporting**
- Built **interactive dashboards** using **Power BI**, pulling data from **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- Created key visualizations to provide insights into:
    - **Total Purchasing Spend** by region, country, and supplier.
    - **Top Performing Products** and **Worst Performing Suppliers**.
    - **Product Sales** across **USA, China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Korea**, and more.
    - **Supplier Performance** based on supplier ratings, order volume, and revenue.
    - **Commodity Analysis**: Breakdown of product categories and their contribution to the total spend.
    - **Purchasing Trends** over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly).

## Key Insights and KPIs

1. **Total Spend by Country/Region**: 
   - Breakdown of purchasing spend across different countries and regions.
   
2. **Top Performing Products**: 
   - Identification of products that contribute the most to total revenue.
   
3. **Supplier Performance**: 
   - Analysis of supplier ratings, order volumes, and total spend.
   
4. **Sales Trends**: 
   - Time-based analysis of sales volumes to identify peak periods and trends.
   
5. **Return Rates**: 
   - Measurement of product return rates and reasons, segmented by region and product.

6. **Discount Impact**: 
   - Analysis of discount application and its impact on total sales.

7. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: 
   - Calculation of average order value across different countries and suppliers.

## Project Benefits
- **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Built to handle large volumes of data efficiently, using Azureâ€™s scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **Incremental and Full Load Support**: Ensures data consistency and up-to-date processing with both full load and incremental data updates.
- **Modular Design**: Each component of the pipeline (ingestion, transformation, presentation) is modular and reusable.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Data is modeled for easy integration with BI tools, supporting real-time analytics and reporting.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)**: Storage of raw data.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehouse for processing and querying.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: ETL/ELT automation and orchestration.
- **Databricks**: Transformation and data manipulation using **PySpark** and **Spark SQL**.
- **Delta Lake**: ACID-compliant data storage for high-performance querying.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboarding.
